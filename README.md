### Advanced Object Orientated Programming Project
## Isometric Game

We were required to implement an isometric game that challenges a player to complete some 
type of quest. 
The game should end, with suitable celebration and fanfare, when the appropriate player action fulfills the quest.

We were given a set of stub classes that implements the basic features of an isometric game, but they were 
deliberately badly designed. The objective was to extend, modify and refactor the code provided to create an 
elegant game design with the aims of accomplishing the following:

• Group together cohesive elements into methods, types and packages.

• Loosely-couple together all programme elements to the maximum extent possible.

• Create a reusable set of abstractions that are defined by interfaces and base classes.

• Encapsulate at method, type, package and module level.

• Apply creational, structural and behavioural design patterns throughout the game where appropriate. 
There  are  obvious  uses  for factories, builders,  flyweights, observers and proxies in an isometric game.

• Use the Swing MVC framework to write custom sprites and game objects.
